## C++ 98 Bootcamp

Welcome to my C++ 98 Bootcamp repository! Here, I document my journey as I train myself in the programming language C++.

### Why C++?
C++ is a versatile, high-performance programming language used in a variety of applications, including system programming, game development, and scientific computing. It offers a mix of high-level and low-level programming constructs that make it a powerful tool for problem-solving.

### What to Expect
In this repository, you'll find my progress as I work through various C++ concepts, from the basics to advanced topics. You can expect to find:
- Examples of C++ code
- Explanations of key concepts
- Practice problems and solutions

### Contributions
