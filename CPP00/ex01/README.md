# PhoneBook

## PURPOSES 
This exercise involves creating a phonebook software using two classes: PhoneBook and Contact. 
The PhoneBook class has an array of contacts with a maximum limit of 8. If a 9th contact is added, it replaces the oldest one. 
The Contact class represents a phonebook contact. The PhoneBook and Contact classes are instantiated as instances of their respective classes. 
The private members of the classes are only used within the class and the public members can be used outside of the class.

## WHAT WILL YOU LEARN
This exercise will teach you how to create and manage two classes, PhoneBook and Contact, in C++. 
It will reinforce your understanding of classes and objects, class properties, and methods. 
You will learn how to create an array of objects, store and manage data, and enforce class constraints such as a maximum number of contacts and the replacement of the oldest contact.
Additionally, you will learn about access control in C++, including the differences between private and public class members, and why this distinction is important for encapsulating class data and functionality.
